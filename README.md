# mLOpinionApp

It is a sentiment analysis app built with .NET

*ML.NET gives you the ability to add machine learning to .NET applications, in either online or offline scenarios. 
*The app focuses on making automatic predictions using the data available rather than needing to be explicitly programmed.
*Developers can train a Machine Learning Model or reuse an existing Model by a 3rd party and run it on any environment offline. 
*Developers do not need to have a background in Data Science to use the framework but will still need the help of data scientists in the  building of the model and in analysing the results.
